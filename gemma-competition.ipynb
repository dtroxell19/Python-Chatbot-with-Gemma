This notebook includes the use of [ROUGE score](https://thepythoncode.com/article/calculate-rouge-score-in-python#rouge-score-a-premier-evaluation-metric). While often used in tasks beyond chatbot-related problems (such as text summarization), ROUGE score is one way to measure the similarity between generated responses to queries and the corresponding ground-truth labels. Three common variants are ROUGE-N, ROUGE-L, and ROUGE-S scores. \n\nSpecifically, this notebook includes the use of ROUGE-L and ROUGE-N (N=2) scores. ROUGE-L is based on the maximum common subsequence that appears in both the response and true label, helping to quantify sentence similariy rather than similarity based on strict word-to-word matches. ROUGE-2 scores quantify the overalp of bigrams between the response and true label.\n\nPut plainly, a ROUGE-2 recall of 0.3 means that 30% of the bigrams in the true label appear in the generated response. A ROUGE-2 precision of 0.3 means that 30% of the bigrams in the generated response appear in the true label. F-measure is a weighted mean of the precision and recall. F-measure is always between 0 and 1, and is only high if both precision and recall are high.

Widely speaking, while pre-trained models can learn general semantic understandings, exposing the model to information regarding specific domains can boost performance in that domain. Moreover, fine-tuning can aid in shaping the style of responses for the model. Below, the Gemma model is fine-tuned on data that was not incorporated into the RAG system. One would intuitively expect the corresponding ROUGE scores on held-out testing data to increase since the model is both exposed to more information about Python and exposed to the style of responses common from these datasets (assuming the held-out data has a similar \"distribution\" to the training data). However, such ROUGE scores can still act as an auditing tool to ensure model quality has not been worsened from an error in the codebase or a collapse in model training.\n\nBelow, an [adaptive learning rate](https://d2l.ai/chapter_optimization/lr-scheduler.html) is employed via a scheduler to hopefully achieve better optimization results. Additionally, the training is performed with [early stopping](https://machinelearningmastery.com/early-stopping-to-avoid-overtraining-neural-network-models/), meaning the algorithm will terminate if a validation metric becomes worse over time. Note that the early stopping method below is fairly conservative; rather than stop training immediately when the validation metric gets worse, it allows for (sometimes long) fluctuations. Essentially, then, the early stopping implementation below simply acts as a safeguard against an unexpected and significant plummeting of model performance.

Moreover, by also performing fine-tuning with existing and novel datasets, the f-measure score further increased to around 0.4. Similarly, the ROUGE-2 scores followed the same trajectory. With these concrete, quantifiable metrics combined with human evaluation on a few prompts, the increased performance and usability of the PyGEM model becomes clear. \n2. **Interpretability and Interactive Usage**: Via the RAG system, context from source documents is fed to the model along with the given prompt to form a response. The RAG system details which document contained the given context (and also warns the user if no relevant chunk of text is found), increasing interpretability. Moreover, the PyGEM model can be employed with a more user-friendly interface thanks to ipywidgets.\n3. **Computational Ease**: Due to the lightweight nature of Gemma models, the PyGEM model was easily created with limited computational resources. Fine-tuning the model via ten epochs with a dataset of around 2000 prompts on a single P100 GPU took less than 3 hours.\n\n# Limitations\n1. **Context Window**: Due to memory allocation concerns, the pre-processor for PyGEM has maximum sequence length of 375. This results in the model being limited in how far back it can \"look\" in the conversation/prompt before providing an answer. Consequently, the chunks for RAG needed to remain relatively small as well (potentially lowering the quality of the retrieved chunks).\n2. **Coding vs. Conceptual**: A primary goal for PyGEM was its versatility in being able to answer coding questions as well as general conceptual questions about Python. If one desired to build a model to solely aid in coding questions, for example, the training dataset would be more curated for this specific purpose.\n3. **Heuristic for RAG Warning**: There is no exact, systematic method for picking a similarity threshold in RAG for when to warn a user if a relevant document is not found. The threshold can be chosen according to how high-stakes the application is or based off of an empirical distribution of similarities gathered via model deployment.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### To go straight to the final model with RAG and the function to ask the model questions (without interface, explanation of code, or calculation of evaluation metrics as done below), can run the cell below <a name=\"MVP\"></a>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"###########LOAD DEPENDENCIES###########\n!pip install langchain langchain-openai faiss-cpu tiktoken\n!pip install chromadb\n!pip install sentence-transformers\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom langchain.vectorstores.chroma import Chroma\nimport keras\nimport keras_nlp\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom langchain.embeddings import SentenceTransformerEmbeddings\nimport sentencepiece\n\n###########GET EMBEDDING MODEL FOR RAG###########\nembeddings = SentenceTransformerEmbeddings(model_name = \"avsolatorio/GIST-small-Embedding-v0\")\n\n###########LOAD RAG DATABASE###########\nvectordb = Chroma(persist_directory=\"/kaggle/input/vectordb/kaggle/working/vectordb\", embedding_function=embeddings)\n\n###########LOAD GEMMA MODEL###########\nmodel = keras_nlp.models.GemmaCausalLM.from_preset(\"gemma_instruct_2b_en\")\n#rank 16 LoRA\nmodel.backbone.enable_lora(rank=16) \n#Only allow model to look back 300 characters for memory purposes\nmodel.preprocessor.sequence_length = 375\n#define the weight decay / learning-rate for the optimizer (AdamW is used for this notebook)\noptimizer = keras.optimizers.AdamW(\n    learning_rate=8.5e-4,\n    weight_decay=0.00025,\n    )\n\n#Exclude layernorm and bias terms from decay to speed up training and reduce memory consumption\noptimizer.exclude_from_weight_decay(var_names=[\"bias\", \"scale\"])\n\n#compile the model by specifying the loss and other metrics we may want to track\nmodel.compile(\n    loss=keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),\n    optimizer=optimizer,\n    weighted_metrics=[keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy()],\n)\n\n\n###########LOAD LORA WEIGHTS FROM PREVIOUS TRAINING###########\nmodel.backbone.load_lora_weights(\"/kaggle/input/fine-tuned-pygem-weights/PyGEM_lora_weights_all_saved.lora.h5\")\n\n###########DEFINE FUNCTION TO ASK MODEL QUESTIONS###########\ndef ask_query(query):\n    '''\n    Given a query, gather appropriate context and pass both into model\n    to get a response\n\n    Parameters:\n    query (str): question to ask the model\n\n    Returns:\n    return_str (str): response from the model\n    '''\n    #for memory purposes, our model does not look back too many characters.\n    #therefore, just grab top 1 chunk most relevant to query\n    context = vectordb.similarity_search_with_relevance_scores(query,k=1)[0]\n    \n    #prompt engineering: add the conext to the question to make the prompt\n    entire_query = '<CONTEXT>:\\n' + context[0].page_content + '\\n\\n<QUESTION>: Answer this <QUESTION> using the <CONTEXT> from above.\\n\\n'+ query + '\\n\\n<RESPONSE>:\\n'\n    #feed into model\n    return_str = model.generate(entire_query,max_length=512)\n    #if there is a relevant document, tell the user where the context was located\n    if context[1] > .7:\n        return_str += '\\n\\nContext taken from '+ context[0].metadata['source'].rsplit('/', 1)[-1]\n    else:\n    #if no relevant documents, still keep in prompt but warn the user about this\n        return_str += '\\n\\n Warning: No relevant context for question in database.'\n    \n    #only return the actual response (not the question and context too)\n    return_str = return_str.rsplit('\\n\\n<RESPONSE>:\\n', 1)[-1]\n    return(return_str)\n\n\n###########ASK QUESTION WITHOUT USER INTERFACE###########\n\nask_query(\"What is Python?\")\n#add other questions here if desired","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Screenshots of Final Results <a name=\"results\"></a>\n\n## Example 1\n![](https://imgur.com/j4qjLY6.png)\n## Example 2\n![](https://imgur.com/RbxvJ4d.png)\n## Example 3\n![](https://imgur.com/MuYcwts.png)\n## Numerical Results\n![](https://imgur.com/XAXlzbT.png)","metadata":{}}]}
